# Star wars challenge
First of all, I want to thank you for reviewing my work. I tried to use an MVVM approach for this project.

In addition to the required tasks: 

- I handled darkmode (I swiped between the first and secondary color of the project).
- I added Activity Indicator before getting api response.
- I did handle reachability, I used a third party library called [Reachability.swift](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift) to achieve this task.
